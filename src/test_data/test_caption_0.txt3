20060803014942.208|20060803014944.277|CC1|SUNDAY AFTER THE BOMBING TO

20060803015006.733|20060803015008.067|CC1|>> Warner: SO WHAT DO YOU SEE AS

20060803015009.769|20060803015011.738|CC1|THIS CIRCLE?
20060803015011.871|20060803015012.405|CC1|AMBASSADOR BOLTON WAS ASKED
20060803015012.538|20060803015013.206|CC1|ABOUT POSSIBILITY, FOR INSTANCE,

20060803015017.043|20060803015017.343|CC1|>> IT IS.
20060803015017.477|20060803015018.544|CC1|THAT IS VERY MUCH NOW THE WAY
20060803015018.678|20060803015021.581|CC1|THAT THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH

20060803015026.586|20060803015027.186|CC1|THOUGHT THIS WOULD GO.
20060803015027.320|20060803015029.489|CC1|THE FIRST RESOLUTION IS STOP THE
20060803015029.622|20060803015031.190|CC1|FIGHTING, AND HERE ARE SOME
20060803015031.324|20060803015032.492|CC1|POLITICAL PRINCIPLES TO WORK ON.

20060803015047.073|20060803015048.708|CC1|BUT THE FACT, IS DOING IT IN AT

20060803015050.877|20060803015053.646|CC1|MORE, CREATES MUCH MORE
20060803015053.780|20060803015054.514|CC1|MANAGEABLE-BITE-SIZED WAYS OF

20060803015057.517|20060803015058.818|CC1|AND ALLOWING YOU TO STOP THE
20060803015058.951|20060803015100.553|CC1|FIGHTING AT THE START, RATHER
20060803015100.687|20060803015102.922|CC1|THAN WAITING UNTIL THE END OF A

20060803020428.360|20060803020430.295|CC1|>> Ifill: HOW SEVERE IS THE
20060803020430.429|20060803020431.396|CC1|ELECTRICITY CRUNCH THIS YEAR?
20060803020431.530|20060803020433.198|CC1|>> WELL, IT'S QITS SEVERE.
20060803020433.332|20060803020434.399|CC1|THE HEAT WAVE IS EXTRAORDINARY.
20060803020434.533|20060803020438.036|CC1|IT CUTS ACROSS A BROAD
20060803020438.170|20060803020438.804|CC1|GEOGRAPHIC SWATH OF THE UNITED
20060803020438.937|20060803020440.105|CC1|STATES, AND IT PUTS A LOT OF
20060803020440.239|20060803020441.240|CC1|PRESSURE ON THE GRID AND THE
20060803020441.373|20060803020444.343|CC1|PEOPLE THAT OPERATE IT.
20060803020444.476|20060803020445.344|CC1|>> Ifill: WOULD WOULD YOU
20060803020445.477|20060803020446.979|CC1|COMPARE IT TO 2003 WHEN WE WENT
20060803020447.112|20060803020448.247|CC1|THROUGH THE BIG BLACKOUT?
20060803020448.380|20060803020451.583|CC1|>> THE IRONY IS 2003 WAS NOT A
20060803020451.717|20060803020452.251|CC1|PARTICULARLY HOT DAY.
20060803020452.384|20060803020453.785|CC1|THERE WAS NO RECORD USAGE.
20060803020453.919|20060803020455.220|CC1|THIS IS A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT.
20060803020455.354|20060803020459.224|CC1|THAT WAS A FAILING IN THE SYSTEM
20060803020459.358|20060803020500.926|CC1|BUT IT HAD RELATIVELY NOTHING TO
20060803020501.059|20060803020501.927|CC1|DO WITH THE WEATHER.
20060803020502.060|20060803020504.129|CC1|>> Ifill: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A
20060803020504.263|20060803020505.230|CC1|FAILURE IN THE SYSTEM, DESCRIBE
20060803020505.364|20060803020506.365|CC1|FOR US AGAIN -- I REMEMBER AT
20060803020506.498|20060803020507.633|CC1|THE TIME TALKING A LOT ABOUT
20060803020507.766|20060803020509.134|CC1|WHAT WENT WRONG, AND IT WAS VERY
20060803020509.268|20060803020511.003|CC1|COMPLICATED, BUT IT INVOLVED THE
20060803020511.136|20060803020511.503|CC1|ELECTRICITY GRID.
20060803020511.637|20060803020513.572|CC1|>> YEAH, IT HASN'T GOTTEN ANY
20060803020513.705|20060803020514.006|CC1|EASIER.
20060803020514.139|20060803020515.040|CC1|IT'S STILL COMPLICATED.
20060803020515.173|20060803020517.242|CC1|THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WAS A
20060803020517.376|20060803020519.511|CC1|CONTROL ROOM WAS NOT GETTING
20060803020519.645|20060803020520.479|CC1|ADEQUATE INFORMATION IN NORTHERN
20060803020520.612|20060803020521.246|CC1|OHIO.
20060803020521.380|20060803020522.648|CC1|THEY WERE ABOUT TO PASS THE
20060803020522.781|20060803020527.286|CC1|CONTROL ON TO THE MIDWEST SYSTEM
20060803020527.419|20060803020529.354|CC1|OPERATION.
20060803020529.488|20060803020535.928|CC1|THE -- AS A RESULT, YOU HAD AN
20060803020536.061|20060803020536.662|CC1|OUTAGE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
20060803020536.795|20060803020540.165|CC1|LOCALIZED, THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
20060803020540.299|20060803020540.933|CC1|CONTROL MECHANISMS IN THE
20060803020541.066|20060803020541.633|CC1|NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS TO PREVENT
20060803020541.767|20060803020545.103|CC1|THE OUTAGE FROM CASCADING ACROSS
20060803020545.237|20060803020545.637|CC1|THE NORTHEAST.
20060803020545.771|20060803020547.139|CC1|BUT IN A NUMBER OF PLACES
20060803020547.272|20060803020548.574|CC1|TDIDN'T WORK, AND IT MOVED SO
20060803020548.707|20060803020550.042|CC1|RAPIDLY, THAT IT BLACKED OUT
20060803020550.175|20060803020552.344|CC1|MUCH OF THE NORTHEAST.
20060803020552.477|20060803020554.279|CC1|IN UTILITY SYSTEMS, IT DID WORK,
20060803020554.413|20060803020555.180|CC1|AND THEY WERE PROTECTED.
20060803020555.314|20060803020557.616|CC1|>> Ifill: AS YOU POINT OUT,
20060803020557.749|20060803020558.550|CC1|THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE DEMAND IN
20060803020558.684|20060803020600.085|CC1|THIS HEAT WAVE THAN THERE SEEMED
20060803020600.218|20060803020601.687|CC1|TO BE AT THAT TIME.
20060803020601.820|20060803020603.956|CC1|IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN
20060803020604.089|20060803020605.591|CC1|THESE KIND OF WIDESPREAD
20060803020605.724|20060803020607.659|CC1|BLACKOUTS A RESULT OF FIXES THAT
20060803020607.793|20060803020608.827|CC1|HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE 2003?
20060803020608.961|20060803020609.861|CC1|>> I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL
20060803020609.995|20060803020610.629|CC1|THINGS.
20060803020610.762|20060803020611.730|CC1|ONE, WHEN THE WEATHER GETS THIS
20060803020611.863|20060803020612.664|CC1|BARKD THE OPERATORS ARE MUCH
20060803020612.798|20060803020614.166|CC1|MORE ATTENTIVE TO WHAT'S GOING
20060803020614.299|20060803020616.568|CC1|ON BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE
20060803020616.702|20060803020616.935|CC1|PRESSURES.
20060803020617.069|20060803020617.836|CC1|THERE HAD BEEN SOME POLICY
20060803020617.970|20060803020619.104|CC1|CHANGES, ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT
20060803020619.237|20060803020620.906|CC1|FULLY IMPLEMENTED, SINCE OUTAGE
20060803020621.039|20060803020621.940|CC1|OF THREE YEARS AGO.
20060803020622.074|20060803020624.209|CC1|TWO OF THEM ARE, ONE, IS A
20060803020624.343|20060803020626.712|CC1|FEDERAL ROLE IN IDENTIFYING
20060803020626.845|20060803020627.713|CC1|NATIONAL CORRIDORS FOR NEW
20060803020627.846|20060803020628.814|CC1|ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION.
20060803020628.947|20060803020630.482|CC1|IT'S NOT BEEN USED YET, BUT IT'S
20060803020630.616|20060803020630.916|CC1|THERE.
20060803020631.049|20060803020632.284|CC1|THE MORE IMPORTANT ONE, FRANKLY,
20060803020632.417|20060803020633.485|CC1|IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOW
20060803020633.619|20060803020634.920|CC1|GOING TO BE MANDATORY
20060803020635.053|20060803020636.221|CC1|RELIABILITY STANDARDS FOR
20060803020636.355|20060803020638.223|CC1|UTILITIES, WHICH AMAZINGLY DID
20060803020638.357|20060803020639.424|CC1|NOT EXIST BEFORE NOW.
20060803020639.558|20060803020641.994|CC1|>> Ifill: IN -- WE WATCHED
20060803020642.127|20060803020643.328|CC1|CAREFULLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
20060803020643.462|20060803020644.630|CC1|WHEN WE SAW THE BLACKOUTS IN ST.
20060803020644.763|20060803020646.798|CC1|LOUIS AND IN QUEENS, NEW YORK,
20060803020646.932|20060803020648.367|CC1|THAT LASTED FOR DAYS ON END.
20060803020648.500|20060803020650.135|CC1|THERE WAS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN
20060803020650.268|20060803020650.869|CC1|WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSE CASES AND
20060803020651.003|20060803020653.705|CC1|THE KIND OF GRID THAT YOU'RE
20060803020653.839|20060803020655.474|CC1|FALKING ABOUT, THE
20060803020655.607|20060803020656.575|CC1|INTERCONNECTION THAT YOU'RE
20060803020656.708|20060803020657.009|CC1|TALKING.
20060803020657.142|20060803020657.242|CC1|B?
20060803020657.376|20060803020658.243|CC1|>> I THINK THE ST. LOUIS
20060803020658.377|20060803020700.412|CC1|SITUATION WAS THE KIND OF THING
20060803020700.545|20060803020702.881|CC1|THAT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE AT
20060803020703.015|20060803020703.248|CC1|ANY TIME.
20060803020703.382|20060803020704.750|CC1|IT WAS CLEARLY WEATHER RELATED.
20060803020704.883|20060803020706.885|CC1|THOSE SORTS OF THINGS HAPPEN
20060803020707.019|20060803020707.619|CC1|PERIODICALLY AROUND THE COUNTRY,
20060803020707.753|20060803020708.320|CC1|AND WE EXPECT THAT.
20060803020708.453|20060803020709.588|CC1|IN QUEEN, I'M NOT SURE THAT IT
20060803020709.721|20060803020711.323|CC1|WAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.
20060803020711.456|20060803020713.525|CC1|IT SEEMED TO BE MORE OF A
20060803020713.659|20060803020714.793|CC1|DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PROBLEM.
20060803020714.926|20060803020717.095|CC1|IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T BLACK OUT
20060803020717.229|20060803020718.196|CC1|ENTIRE CITY OF NEW YORK.
20060803020718.330|20060803020720.232|CC1|BUT NEW YORK I SHOULD POINT OUT,
20060803020720.365|20060803020721.333|CC1|AND SOUTHWEST CONNECTICUT, WHICH
20060803020721.466|20060803020722.100|CC1|NEIGHBORS IT, HAS BEEN
20060803020722.234|20060803020724.469|CC1|IDENTIFIED IN STUDIES AS AREAS
20060803020724.603|20060803020726.071|CC1|WHERE THERE ARE SEVERE
20060803020726.204|20060803020727.005|CC1|CONSRAINTS ON THE TRANSMISSION
20060803020727.139|20060803020728.306|CC1|GRID, AND THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR
20060803020728.440|20060803020729.741|CC1|ANY PLACE WHERE YOU'RE BRINGING
20060803020729.875|20060803020731.843|CC1|POWER OVER LONG DISTANCES TO BE
20060803020731.977|20060803020734.413|CC1|CONSUMED AT A PARTICULAR PLACE,
20060803020734.546|20060803020735.480|CC1|AND THE LINES, BASICALLY, ARE
20060803020735.614|20060803020737.315|CC1|DRAINED BY NEW YORK CITY, AND
20060803020737.449|20060803020739.518|CC1|THE RESULT IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS
20060803020739.651|20060803020740.719|CC1|NOT AS STABLE AS IT MIGHT BE IN
20060803020740.852|20060803020741.953|CC1|OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.
20060803020742.087|20060803020744.122|CC1|>> Ifill: IS THERE EVERY A TIME,
20060803020744.256|20060803020746.658|CC1|AS YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTROL THE
20060803020746.792|20060803020748.593|CC1|FLOW OF POWER, ESPECIALLY IN
20060803020748.727|20060803020749.461|CC1|HIGH-DEMAND AREAS LIKE NEW YORK
20060803020749.594|20060803020750.462|CC1|CITY AND THE NORTHEAST, WHERE IT
20060803020750.595|20060803020752.364|CC1|SERVES A PURPOSE -- CALIFORNIA
20060803020752.497|20060803020753.965|CC1|-- WHERE IT SERVES A PURPOSE TO
20060803020754.099|20060803020756.468|CC1|HAVE BLACKOUTS, TO HAVE
20060803020756.601|20060803020756.835|CC1|BROWNOUTS?
20060803020756.968|20060803020757.736|CC1|>> YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
20060803020757.869|20060803020801.039|CC1|THE PEOPLE THAT OPERATE THE GRID
20060803020801.173|20060803020803.408|CC1|OPERATE ON A NUMBER OF

20060803020804.042|20060803020805.444|CC1|AND OBVIOUSLY THEY WANT TO AVOID
20060803020805.577|20060803020806.812|CC1|BROWNOUTS OR BLACKOUTS, BUT
20060803020806.945|20060803020808.513|CC1|SOMETIMES WHERE IT'S UNAVOIDABLE
20060803020808.647|20060803020811.349|CC1|IS A BETTER OPTION IS TO HAVE A
20060803020811.483|20060803020812.951|CC1|CONTROLLED BLACKOUT, WHERE THEY
20060803020813.085|20060803020814.820|CC1|BLACKOUT NEIGHBORHOOD X. TO
20060803020814.953|20060803020815.921|CC1|PROTECT THE REST OF THE SYSTEM.
20060803020816.054|20060803020817.923|CC1|THEY MAY USE ROLLING BLACKOUTS,
20060803020818.056|20060803020818.857|CC1|BLACKOUT ONE AREA FOR A PERIOD
20060803020818.990|20060803020819.891|CC1|OF TIME, ANOTHER AREA.
20060803020820.025|20060803020821.159|CC1|IT'S A WAY TO DEAL WITH
20060803020821.293|20060803020821.960|CC1|CONSTRAINTS IN A MANAGEABLE WAY,
20060803020822.094|20060803020825.063|CC1|NOT NECESSARILY AN APPEALING WAY
20060803020825.197|20060803020826.798|CC1|TO CONSUMER, BUT LESS
20060803020826.932|20060803020827.566|CC1|CATASTROPHIC THAN WHAT YOU SAW
20060803020827.699|20060803020828.567|CC1|IN 2003.
20060803020828.700|20060803020829.735|CC1|>> Ifill: WE HAVE BEEN TOLD TO
