20060613023503.360|20060613023505.095|CC1|SHOW AND WE HEARD IT FROM THE
20060613023505.228|20060613023506.063|CC1|PRESIDENT WHILE HE WAS IN
20060613023506.196|20060613023507.998|CC1|BAGHDAD THERE, THAT THE IRAQIS
20060613023508.131|20060613023508.865|CC1|CAN DEFEND THEMSELVES.
20060613023508.999|20060613023510.534|CC1|THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF
20060613023510.667|20060613023511.902|CC1|THIS SECURITY PLAN.
20060613023512.035|20060613023513.270|CC1|VICTORIA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
20060613023513.403|20060613023515.372|CC1|THE U.S. DOES, WHAT DOES IT DO?
20060613023515.505|20060613023517.174|CC1|DOES IT GO FULL IN WITH ALL OF
20060613023517.307|20060613023519.576|CC1|ITS FORCES TRYING TO SUPPORT THE
20060613023519.710|20060613023521.178|CC1|IRAQIS OR DOES IT STAND BACK AND
20060613023521.311|20060613023522.446|CC1|LET THEM DO IT?
20060613023522.579|20060613023524.414|CC1|>> IT'S NOT AN EITHER/OR
20060613023524.548|20060613023525.515|CC1|SITUATION AND I DON'T MEAN TO
20060613023525.649|20060613023527.651|CC1|MAKE IT SOUND AS SIMPLY AS THE
20060613023527.784|20060613023529.252|CC1|ANECDOTE I'M ABOUT TO GIVE, BUT
20060613023529.386|20060613023530.620|CC1|IT'S TEACHING LIKE SOMEBODY HOW
20060613023530.754|20060613023531.621|CC1|TO RIDE A BIKE.
20060613023531.755|20060613023533.657|CC1|YOU HELD THEM UP ON THE BIKE AND
20060613023533.790|20060613023535.359|CC1|RUN ALONGSIDE WITH ONE HAND ON
20060613023535.492|20060613023536.827|CC1|EITHER SIDE AND THEN YOU ARE
20060613023536.960|20060613023538.161|CC1|HOLDING ON WITH THE FINGERTIPS
20060613023538.295|20060613023539.696|CC1|AND AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU LET
20060613023539.830|20060613023542.032|CC1|GO AND THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN, BUT
20060613023542.165|20060613023543.367|CC1|THE CRITICAL QUESTION IS KNOWING
20060613023543.500|20060613023544.134|CC1|WHEN TO LET GO.
20060613023544.267|20060613023546.503|CC1|I THINK WE DO A DISSERVICE BY
20060613023546.636|20060613023547.604|CC1|PUTTING LABELS ON THINGS AND
20060613023547.738|20060613023549.239|CC1|SAYING TODAY IS A TURNING POINT
20060613023549.373|20060613023550.974|CC1|OR TOMORROW WILL BE A DEFINING
20060613023551.108|20060613023552.342|CC1|MOMENT.
20060613023552.476|20060613023553.643|CC1|IN SOMETHING AS CHALLENGING AS
20060613023553.777|20060613023554.845|CC1|THE SITUATION IN IRAQ IT WILL
20060613023554.978|20060613023556.046|CC1|TAKE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT AND
20060613023556.179|20060613023557.547|CC1|LOOK BACK AND SAY WHAT WERE THE
20060613023557.681|20060613023558.782|CC1|TRUE TURNING POINTS.
20060613023558.915|20060613023600.450|CC1|WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS -- NO, I
20060613023600.584|20060613023600.951|CC1|MEAN THAT.
20060613023601.084|20060613023602.252|CC1|>> I MEAN IT, TOO.
20060613023602.386|20060613023604.354|CC1|I THINK THE SECURITY PLAN AND I
20060613023604.488|20060613023606.556|CC1|THINK PUTTING 40 TO 70,000
20060613023606.690|20060613023609.292|CC1|TROOPS ON THE STREETS OF BAGHDAD
20060613023609.426|20060613023610.894|CC1|WHAT NINA IS TELLING US, THIS IS
20060613023611.027|20060613023612.429|CC1|THE WORST SITUATION THEY'VE EVER
20060613023612.562|20060613023612.796|CC1|FACED.
20060613023612.929|20060613023613.797|CC1|THIS IS THE TEST OF THE
20060613023613.930|20060613023614.297|CC1|GOVERNMENT.
20060613023614.431|20060613023615.332|CC1|YOU CAN'T DENY THAT.
20060613023615.465|20060613023616.867|CC1|>> I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT
20060613023617.000|20060613023618.802|CC1|TEST TO THE GOVERNMENT.
20060613023618.935|20060613023622.105|CC1|THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE

20060613023646.329|20060613023648.198|CC1|POINT AS REALLY HELPING THEM?
20060613023648.331|20060613023650.033|CC1|>> ABSOLUTELY.

20060613023652.035|20060613023653.003|CC1|THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER MOMENTS
20060613023653.136|20060613023654.805|CC1|WHERE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT

20060613023737.481|20060613023738.682|CC1|>> THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO MORE
20060613023738.815|20060613023740.283|CC1|OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY
20060613023740.417|20060613023742.719|CC1|WHICH IS ASSUME MORE CONTROL AND

20060613023827.330|20060613023830.300|CC1|THE SAME TIME IT'S THE MESSAGE
20060613023830.433|20060613023831.334|CC1|THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS TO
20060613023831.468|20060613023832.702|CC1|GO SEE THE PRESIDENT IN THE

20060613023833.403|20060613023835.005|CC1|SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SHOW THAT

20060613040432.824|20060613040435.427|CC1|>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAKING

20060613040443.568|20060613040445.303|CC1|>> THAT IS WHERE HE IS MOST

20060613040445.804|20060613040446.838|CC1|I THINK THAT IS THE AIRPORT
20060613040446.971|20060613040448.173|CC1|FIRST THAT HE COMES INTO.
20060613040448.306|20060613040450.041|CC1|NO ONE KNEW HE WAS COMING.
20060613040450.175|20060613040451.476|CC1|THAT WAS EXCEPTIONAL SECURITY,
20060613040451.609|20060613040452.610|CC1|BUT SOMEWHAT OF A SURPRISE.
20060613040452.744|20060613040454.112|CC1|ONCE HE IS THERE, OF COURSE,

20060613040459.384|20060613040501.119|CC1|HELICOPTER AND THAT IS WHERE HE
20060613040501.252|20060613040501.820|CC1|IS EXPOSED TO ANYTHING THAT
20060613040501.953|20060613040502.520|CC1|COULD COME FROM THE GROUND.
20060613040502.654|20060613040503.888|CC1|THAT IS WHAT HIS SECURITY
20060613040504.022|20060613040505.190|CC1|ADVISORS WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST
20060613040505.323|20060613040505.857|CC1|CONCERNED ABOUT.

20060613040514.933|20060613040517.001|CC1|BUT THAT SECOND HOP TO HAVE HIM
20060613040517.135|20060613040518.770|CC1|AT THE EMBASSY COMPOUND WOULD
20060613040518.903|20060613040520.071|CC1|HAVE BEEN THE MORE DANGEROUS

20060613043339.736|20060613043341.137|CC1|>> I KNOW THAT THE LOCAL

20060613043345.875|20060613043347.544|CC1|>> SO, IT LOOKS LIKE, I'M GOING
20060613043347.677|20060613043349.412|CC1|ON A WEBSITE BECAUSE THERE'S A
20060613043349.546|20060613043350.680|CC1|WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

20060613043417.907|20060613043419.142|CC1|BUT IT'S BEEN HEATING UP OVER

20060613043553.069|20060613043553.670|CC1|GREAT WEATHER ACROSS PARTS OF
20060613043553.803|20060613043554.404|CC1|THE SOUTHWEST AND NOT SO GREAT
20060613043554.537|20060613043556.005|CC1|IN THE SOUTHEAST, BUT THIS RAIN
20060613043556.139|20060613043557.840|CC1|ACTUALLY REALLY WELCOMED AND
20060613043557.974|20060613043559.275|CC1|ALBERTO BARELY A TROPICAL STORM
20060613043559.409|20060613043559.876|CC1|ANY MORE.
20060613043600.009|20060613043602.111|CC1|WE HAVE 40 MILE PER HOUR
20060613043602.245|20060613043603.479|CC1|SUSTAINED WINDS AND DOWN TO A
20060613043603.613|20060613043604.647|CC1|TROPICAL DEPRESSION BEFORE WE
20060613043604.781|20060613043605.615|CC1|KNOW IT.
20060613043605.748|20060613043606.883|CC1|SOME THREATS WE HAVE TO DEAL
20060613043607.016|20060613043608.384|CC1|WITH AND ONE OF WHICH IS THE
20060613043608.518|20060613043611.087|CC1|THREAT OF TORNADOES.
20060613043611.220|20060613043613.389|CC1|AS THESE OUTER BANDS AND WE GET
20060613043613.523|20060613043614.123|CC1|THESE SPINNERS MOVING ON SHORE
20060613043614.257|20060613043618.361|CC1|AND THEY CAN PRODUCE WEAK F-0
20060613043618.494|20060613043619.362|CC1|TORNADOES.
20060613043619.495|20060613043621.898|CC1|WHEN THOSE SIRENS GO OFF, THE
20060613043622.031|20060613043625.969|CC1|AREA OF ROTATION NORTH OF HILTON
20060613043626.102|20060613043628.104|CC1|HEAD AND GARDEN'S CORNER ARE ALL
20060613043628.237|20060613043630.139|CC1|IN THE PATH OF THIS STORM AS IT
20060613043630.273|20060613043630.907|CC1|HEADS UP TO THE NORTH AND TO THE
20060613043631.040|20060613043633.142|CC1|WEST.
20060613043633.276|20060613043634.210|CC1|NOW, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
20060613043634.344|20060613043635.311|CC1|SEE THESE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF
20060613043635.445|20060613043636.779|CC1|THE AFTERNOON HOURS AS THOSE
20060613043636.913|20060613043638.915|CC1|TEMPERATURES START TO HEAT UP.
20060613043639.048|20060613043640.183|CC1|I THINK THE THREAT OF TORNADOES
20060613043640.316|20060613043641.551|CC1|ARE MORE LIKELY AND ALL THE
20060613043641.684|20060613043642.785|CC1|WATCHES AT THIS HOUR ARE
20060613043642.919|20060613043644.153|CC1|CANCELED AND WE THINK WE'LL SEE
20060613043644.287|20060613043645.455|CC1|ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE LATER ON
20060613043645.588|20060613043647.156|CC1|THIS AFTERNOON.
20060613043647.290|20060613043649.092|CC1|WE SAW LANDFALL TODAY ABOUT
20060613043649.225|20060613043650.693|CC1|12:30 EASTERN TIME AND THAT WAS
20060613043650.827|20060613043652.595|CC1|NEAR ADAM'S BEACH INTO THE BIG
20060613043652.729|20060613043654.130|CC1|BEND AREA AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING
20060613043654.263|20060613043657.066|CC1|AT HERE, THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
20060613043657.200|20060613043658.468|CC1|THE WATER VAPOR LOOK OR IMAGERY
20060613043658.601|20060613043700.336|CC1|AND IT SHOWS YOU WHERE THE
20060613043700.470|20060613043701.904|CC1|MOISTURE AND DRY AIR IS AND THIS
20060613043702.038|20060613043703.573|CC1|IS PART OF THE REASON WHY
20060613043703.706|20060613043705.241|CC1|ALBERTO WEAKENED BEFORE IT MADE
20060613043705.375|20060613043705.642|CC1|LANDFALL.
20060613043705.775|20060613043707.543|CC1|ALL OF THE ORANGES AND THE GRAYS
20060613043707.677|20060613043708.978|CC1|THAT YOU CAN SEE IN HERE.
20060613043709.112|20060613043711.280|CC1|THAT'S DRY AIR WHICH HAS BEEN IN
20060613043711.414|20060613043712.915|CC1|THIS STORM HELPING TO WEAKEN IT
20060613043713.049|20060613043713.983|CC1|AND NOW WE HAVE THE FRICTION
20060613043714.117|20060613043715.685|CC1|WITH THE CENTER OF ROTATION OVER
20060613043715.818|20060613043717.220|CC1|LAND, SO, ALL THOSE FACTORS
20060613043717.353|20060613043718.955|CC1|WORKING TO BRING ALBERTO DOWN TO
20060613043719.088|20060613043722.692|CC1|THAT DEPRESSION STATUS.
20060613043722.825|20060613043724.060|CC1|NOW, IN ADDITION TO THE
20060613043724.193|20060613043726.496|CC1|TORNADOES, WE HAVE TO WORRY
20060613043726.629|20060613043727.330|CC1|ABOUT THE RAINFALL THAT WILL
20060613043727.463|20060613043728.064|CC1|PULL UP INTO THE NORTH AND THE
20060613043728.197|20060613043729.065|CC1|EAST.
20060613043729.198|20060613043730.833|CC1|FORECAST TRACK IS BRINGING UP
20060613043730.967|20060613043732.101|CC1|TOWARDS SOUTH CAROLINA AND TO
20060613043732.235|20060613043733.803|CC1|THE EAST OF COLUMBIA BY TOMORROW
20060613043733.936|20060613043735.505|CC1|MORNING AND THEN HEADING OFF THE
20060613043735.638|20060613043739.275|CC1|COAST OF THE DEL MARVA AND BACK
20060613043739.409|20060613043740.543|CC1|OVER OPEN WATER.
20060613043740.677|20060613043742.145|CC1|THERE IS A CHANCE THIS COULD GET
20060613043742.278|20060613043745.014|CC1|BACK UP TO STORM STRENGTH AGAIN.
20060613043745.148|20060613043746.482|CC1|BUT AT THIS TIME, WE REALLY
20060613043746.616|20060613043747.917|CC1|DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A BIG
20060613043748.051|20060613043749.285|CC1|PLAYER HERE INTO THE NORTHEAST.
20060613043749.419|20060613043750.653|CC1|WE'VE BEEN KIND OF CONCERNED
20060613043750.787|20060613043752.355|CC1|ABOUT IT, WATCHING IT VERY
20060613043752.488|20060613043753.389|CC1|CLOSELY BECAUSE THE NORTHEAST
20060613043753.523|20060613043754.657|CC1|HAS BEEN SO SOGGY.
20060613043754.791|20060613043756.159|CC1|WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE
20060613043756.292|20060613043757.427|CC1|POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING.
20060613043757.560|20060613043758.394|CC1|WHERE IS THE FLOODING GOING TO
20060613043758.528|20060613043758.695|CC1|BE?

20060613064355.010|20060613064357.279|CC1|FACT THAT ZARQAWI HAS BEEN

20060613064402.251|20060613064404.152|CC1|LIKE HE CHANGED KOURBSZ IN IRAN.
20060613064404.286|20060613064406.154|CC1|I THINK IT'S GOOD.
20060613064406.288|20060613064409.157|CC1|I THINK I AM ENCOURAGED

20060613064416.665|20060613064419.101|CC1|IF, COME SEPTEMBER THINGS ARE AS
20060613064419.234|20060613064420.969|CC1|BAD AS THEY ARE NOW, THEN IT
20060613064421.103|20060613064423.071|CC1|WASN'T MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
20060613064423.205|20060613064425.907|CC1|THREE THINGS HAVE TO BE DONE.
20060613064426.074|20060613064427.976|CC1|THE FIRST IS GET THE SUNIS TO
20060613064428.110|20060613064430.212|CC1|BUY IN AMEND THE CONSTITUTION

20060613064439.688|20060613064441.857|CC1|SO THE IRAQIS HAVE A FORCE THAT
20060613064441.990|20060613064443.692|CC1|CAN GAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL
20060613064443.825|20060613064445.260|CC1|THE PEOPLE AND RESTORE ORDER.

20060613064458.874|20060613064500.709|CC1|IS TALKING TO IRAQ ABOUT.

20060613064511.253|20060613064512.688|CC1|ADMINISTRATION FOR NOT HAVING A

20060613064517.092|20060613064517.993|CC1|AVOID DEFEAT?
20060613064518.126|20060613064519.328|CC1|>> THAT'S RIGHT.
20060613064519.461|20060613064521.129|CC1|THAT'S WHAT IT'S BEEN SO FAR.
20060613064521.263|20060613064523.065|CC1|THAT'S WHY I'M HOPEFUL, WOLF.
