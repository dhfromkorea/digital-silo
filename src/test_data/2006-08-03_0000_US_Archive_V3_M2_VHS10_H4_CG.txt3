20060803042308.472|20060803042310.541|CC1|MANY REASONS WHY IT'S THE NUMBER
20060803042310.674|20060803042312.109|CC1|ONE WATER PARK IN THE COUNTRY.
20060803042312.242|20060803042313.610|CC1|I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST
20060803042313.744|20060803042315.879|CC1|REASONS IS THAT IT DRAWS FROM
20060803042316.013|20060803042317.147|CC1|THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF THE
20060803042317.281|20060803042317.614|CC1|REGION.
20060803042317.748|20060803042319.183|CC1|A THIRD OF THE PARK IS ACTUALLY
20060803042319.316|20060803042320.317|CC1|RIVER FED.
20060803042320.450|20060803042324.221|CC1|THEY PUMP IN RIVER WATER, 72
20060803042324.354|20060803042324.755|CC1|DEGREES.
20060803042324.888|20060803042327.357|CC1|AND EVERY EVING PUMPED OUT
20060803042327.491|20060803042327.791|CC1|AGAIN.
20060803042327.925|20060803042329.993|CC1|A FUN LITTLE WATER FACT FOR YOU
20060803042330.127|20060803042331.428|CC1|CHRIS IS THAT THROUGHOUT THE
20060803042331.562|20060803042333.463|CC1|ENTIRE PARK, THERE ARE LIKE FIVE
20060803042333.597|20060803042336.466|CC1|MILLION GALLONS OF WATER
20060803042336.600|20060803042338.802|CC1|CIRCULATING AT ANY GIVEN TIME.
20060803042338.936|20060803042340.571|CC1|COMPARE THAT TO THE NIAGARA
20060803042340.704|20060803042343.407|CC1|FALLS, BECAUSE IN ONE MINUTE,
20060803042343.540|20060803042345.309|CC1|SIX MILLION GOES OVER THOSE
20060803042345.442|20060803042345.676|CC1|FALLS.
20060803042345.809|20060803042347.978|CC1|>> WOW, NOW A LOT OF WATER.
20060803042348.111|20060803042350.347|CC1|DOES THAT MEAN A LOT OF WATER
20060803042350.480|20060803042350.881|CC1|FILTRATION.
20060803042351.014|20060803042352.382|CC1|HOW CLEAN IS THAT WATER?
20060803042352.516|20060803042354.117|CC1|>> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
20060803042354.251|20060803042356.286|CC1|WAWS THERE ARE A LOT OF
20060803042356.420|20060803042357.688|CC1|TWO-YEAR-OLD'S IN THE PARK.
20060803042357.821|20060803042400.290|CC1|BUT THEY ALL WEAR SWIM DIAPERS
20060803042400.424|20060803042402.459|CC1|AND THE OTHER PARTSF THE PARK
20060803042402.593|20060803042405.729|CC1|ARE CHLORINATED AND FILL ER THED
20060803042405.863|20060803042408.198|CC1|AND SAMPLES ARE TAKEN THROUGHOUT
