20060803002601.259|20060803002603.394|CC1|IMPACT EVEN IF SHE'S NOT SOLELY
20060803002603.461|20060803002605.763|CC1|AWARE OF WHAT THE IMPACT IS?
20060803002605.897|20060803002606.164|CC1|>> YES.
20060803002606.297|20060803002608.199|CC1|>> Dr. Phil: HER BEHAVIOR WAS

20060803002609.300|20060803002611.302|CC1|SO REALLY TO TIE IT WITH
20060803002611.369|20060803002613.671|CC1|ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED, EVEN HER
20060803002613.738|20060803002615.607|CC1|MOM DYING, AS TERRIBLE AS THAT

20060803002629.954|20060803002630.555|CC1|>> Dr. Phil: YOU DIDN'T FEEL
20060803002630.622|20060803002631.789|CC1|THAT WAY, DID YOU?
20060803002631.923|20060803002632.156|CC1|>> NO.
20060803002632.290|20060803002633.791|CC1|>> SHE DID AT FIRST.
20060803002633.858|20060803002635.893|CC1|SHE USED TO BE SO EXCITED WHEN
20060803002635.960|20060803002637.495|CC1|WE WOULD GO SEE HILARY.
20060803002637.629|20060803002638.997|CC1|>> Dr. Phil: THEN YOU HAVE THIS

20060803002641.065|20060803002642.433|CC1|IT STARTS OUT OKAY, BUT THEN
20060803002642.500|20060803002643.768|CC1|IT'S NOT OKAY.
20060803002643.901|20060803002646.771|CC1|>> THEN HER BEHAVIOR BECAME SORT
20060803002646.838|20060803002647.338|CC1|OF WEIRD.
20060803002647.405|20060803002650.308|CC1|SHE WAS SITTING ON PEOPLE'S LAPS
20060803002650.375|20060803002653.578|CC1|AT 14, STRANGERS' LAPS, MY LAP,
20060803002653.645|20060803002654.646|CC1|WANTED CONSTANT ATTENTION, AND I
20060803002654.712|20060803002655.980|CC1|THOUGHT, OKAY, I'LL ATTRIBUTE
20060803002656.047|20060803002658.683|CC1|THIS TO MAYBE HER MOTHER DYING,
20060803002658.750|20060803002700.618|CC1|BUT IT JUST CONTINUED.
20060803002700.685|20060803002703.554|CC1|AND THEN TOWARD THE END BEFORE
20060803002703.621|20060803002704.989|CC1|WE SENT HER TO SCHOOL, SHE
20060803002705.056|20060803002706.391|CC1|WOULDN'T TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
20060803002706.457|20060803002706.791|CC1|PHYSICALLY.
20060803002706.858|20060803002707.659|CC1|SHE WAS DEPRESSED.
20060803002707.725|20060803002709.694|CC1|HER GRADES WERE GOING DOWN.
20060803002709.761|20060803002711.529|CC1|WE THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA LOSE
20060803002711.596|20060803002712.497|CC1|HER ALTOGETHER.

20060803003345.856|20060803003346.757|CC1|A BUNCH OF CRAP.
20060803003346.824|20060803003347.625|CC1|IT WASN'T MISTAKE.

20060803003351.395|20060803003353.164|CC1|AND THEN WHEN YOU CAME HOME, YOU

20060803003354.198|20060803003356.867|CC1|YOU HAD TO LIVE IN THE PLAYROOM.

20060803003406.277|20060803003407.511|CC1|SHE'S OUT OF CONTROL.
20060803003407.578|20060803003409.747|CC1|WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER.
20060803003409.814|20060803003413.217|CC1|WE OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT CAPABLE OF
20060803003413.284|20060803003414.618|CC1|DOING IT.
20060803003414.685|20060803003415.753|CC1|HER DEATH BROUGHT AN END TO
20060803003415.820|20060803003420.024|CC1|THAT, BUT WHEN THE BEHAVIOR THEN
20060803003420.091|20060803003422.693|CC1|REAPPEARED AFTER HILARY CAME, IT
20060803003422.760|20060803003425.096|CC1|WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

20060803003428.365|20060803003430.334|CC1|BUT THEY WERE NOT AT OUR DOING
20060803003430.401|20060803003433.270|CC1|IN THAT THAT WAS THE RULE OF THE
20060803003433.337|20060803003433.604|CC1|SCHOOL.
20060803003433.671|20060803003436.907|CC1|IT WAS OUR LAST DESPERATE HOPE
20060803003436.974|20060803003439.243|CC1|TO CHANGE HER INTO THE PERSON
20060803003439.310|20060803003441.412|CC1|THAT WE KNOW THAT SHE'S CAPABLE

20060803003457.895|20060803003458.496|CC1|>> Dr. Phil: Y'ALL MADE THE

20060803003502.366|20060803003504.635|CC1|>> YES, WE DID LIE TO HER, AND,
20060803003504.702|20060803003506.137|CC1|YES, WE DID LEAVE HER THERE, BUT
20060803003506.203|20060803003507.404|CC1|THAT WAS WHAT WAS NECESSARY
20060803003507.471|20060803003508.572|CC1|BECAUSE HER BEHAVIOR WAS SO OUT
20060803003508.639|20060803003509.940|CC1|OF CONTROL.
20060803003510.074|20060803003510.741|CC1|>> Dr. Phil: SO THAT WOULD BE A

20060803003518.582|20060803003519.683|CC1|I COULDN'T CONTROL THE CANCER.
20060803003519.750|20060803003521.152|CC1|BUT IT WAS TOTALLY IN MY

20060803003530.494|20060803003531.629|CC1|AND THEN YOU SAID THAT IT IS
20060803003531.695|20060803003532.663|CC1|ACCURATE THAT YOU DID NOT SPEAK

20060803003541.438|20060803003543.140|CC1|PROGRESSED QUICKER WE COULD HAVE

20060803004240.824|20060803004242.192|CC1|>> SHE LIVED WITH US FOR ABOUT

20060803004243.160|20060803004244.361|CC1|>> Dr. Phil: HOW WAS SHE TO LIVE

20060803004244.795|20060803004245.195|CC1|>> SHE WAS FINE.
20060803004245.262|20060803004247.030|CC1|I MEAN, SHE WAS THE TYPICAL
20060803004247.097|20060803004247.397|CC1|TEENAGER.
20060803004247.464|20060803004249.833|CC1|ANY TEENAGER AND AN ADULT OR
20060803004249.900|20060803004250.934|CC1|AUTHORITY FIGURE, THEY'RE GOING
20060803004251.001|20060803004252.002|CC1|TO HAVE THEIR CONFLICTS.
20060803004252.069|20060803004253.637|CC1|I NEVER FOUND HER TO BE
20060803004253.704|20060803004254.071|CC1|DISRESPECTFUL.
20060803004254.137|20060803004255.839|CC1|I FOUND HER TO BE VERY RECEPTIVE
20060803004255.906|20060803004256.907|CC1|TO ANYTHING MY HUSBAND AND I HAD
20060803004256.974|20060803004257.774|CC1|TO SAY TO HER.
20060803004257.841|20060803004259.209|CC1|SHE WAS A JOY.
20060803004259.276|20060803004300.177|CC1|SHE TRULY WAS.
20060803004300.243|20060803004302.245|CC1|I FIND IT VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO
20060803004302.312|20060803004303.580|CC1|THE THINGS THA ARE BEING SAID
20060803004303.647|20060803004305.248|CC1|ABOUT HER BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I

20060803004310.420|20060803004311.488|CC1|WONDER!
20060803004311.555|20060803004314.124|CC1|YOU PEOPLE SENT HER TO MEXICO
20060803004314.191|20060803004314.825|CC1|FOR 16 MONTHS.

20060803004322.299|20060803004323.467|CC1|>> THAT'S WHY WE DID IT WAS
20060803004323.533|20060803004324.801|CC1|BECAUSE WE LOVED HER.
20060803004324.868|20060803004326.503|CC1|IT WAS OUT OF LOVE THAT WE DID
20060803004326.570|20060803004327.471|CC1|IT.
20060803004327.604|20060803004329.272|CC1|>> AND YOU HAD NO CONTACT WITH

20060803004330.741|20060803004332.309|CC1|>> NO, WE HAD WEEKLY CONTACT,
20060803004332.376|20060803004335.212|CC1|JUST NOT DIRECTLY WITH HER.
20060803004335.345|20060803004335.746|CC1|>> I'M SORRY --
20060803004335.879|20060803004337.014|CC1|>> AND YOU KEEP GOING TO THE
20060803004337.080|20060803004338.815|CC1|SAME PLACE.
20060803004338.882|20060803004341.551|CC1|AS IF ALL THIS HAPPENED --

20060803004345.155|20060803004348.058|CC1|BUT IN MY OPINION, AS A PARENT,
20060803004348.125|20060803004350.661|CC1|IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY TO LOVE,
20060803004350.727|20060803004352.195|CC1|PROTECT, AND CARE FOR OUR
20060803004352.262|20060803004352.562|CC1|CHILDREN.
20060803004352.696|20060803004353.330|CC1|>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE
