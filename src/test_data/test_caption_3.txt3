20060613061545.822|20060613061548.792|CC1|HAS BEEN VERY SLOW, IT'S VERY
20060613061548.859|20060613061550.260|CC1|DIFFICULT, IF A COUNTRY THAT

20060613061553.530|20060613061553.997|CC1|DEMOCRACY.
20060613061554.064|20060613061555.799|CC1|WE HAVE CREATED THE CONDITIONS,

20060613061616.153|20060613061618.221|CC1|THEN OUR SACRIFICES WILL HAVE
20060613061618.288|20060613061619.990|CC1|BEEN WORTH IT.
20060613061620.057|20060613061621.358|CC1|IRAQ WILL BE SAFER, THE MIDDLE

20060613061643.547|20060613061644.982|CC1|>> WELL, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
20060613061645.048|20060613061646.183|CC1|TO TALK TO THE EXPERTS WHEN I
20060613061646.249|20060613061649.319|CC1|WAS IN IRAQ IN JANUARY AND AGO

20060613061651.722|20060613061653.657|CC1|ABOUT A YEAR AGO, BUT OUR TOP
20060613061653.724|20060613061656.293|CC1|PEOPLE BOTH MILITARY AND

20060613061717.748|20060613061719.282|CC1|IF WE WALK OUT AND LEE THEM NOW,
20060613061719.349|20060613061722.819|CC1|THE CHANCES ARE FAR TOO GOOD
20060613061722.886|20060613061725.422|CC1|THAT INSURGENCY, CHAOS, AND
20060613061725.489|20060613061727.758|CC1|TERRORISM WILL PREVAIL, AND THIS
20060613061727.824|20060613061730.193|CC1|WOULD BE ONCE AGAIN, A PRIME

20060613061733.497|20060613061735.032|CC1|THREATENS THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ AND

20060613061740.404|20060613061741.638|CC1|>> HOW MANY MORE YEARS DO YOU
20060613061741.705|20060613061744.741|CC1|THINK THE UNITED STATES WILL
20060613061744.808|20060613061746.443|CC1|SUPPORT 100,000 TROOPS IN IRAQ?
20060613061746.510|20060613061748.045|CC1|>> WELL, I THINK THE NUMBER WILL
20060613061748.111|20060613061750.580|CC1|COME DOWN AS THE IRAQIS ARE
20060613061750.647|20060613061752.215|CC1|CAPABLE OF TAKING OVER MORE
20060613061752.282|20060613061753.984|CC1|SECURITY FUNCTIONS.
20060613061754.051|20060613061756.219|CC1|YOU KNOW, WE STILL -- WE'RE
20060613061756.286|20060613061758.221|CC1|STILL DRAWING DOWN 40,000 TROOPS
20060613061758.288|20060613061800.457|CC1|THAT WE'VE HAD HAD IN KOREA.
20060613061800.524|20060613061802.426|CC1|WE'RE STILL IN BOSNIA, WE'RE
20060613061802.492|20060613061804.094|CC1|STILL IN OTHER AREAS.
20060613061804.161|20060613061806.263|CC1|THE UNITED STATES IS IT IN A
20060613061806.329|20060613061808.165|CC1|DECADES LONG WAR AGAINST TERROR
20060613061808.231|20060613061809.633|CC1|AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE
20060613061809.733|20060613061812.202|CC1|TROOPS DEPLOYED WHERE TERROR
20060613061812.269|20060613061813.236|CC1|EXISTS.
20060613061813.303|20060613061815.639|CC1|I HOPE WE CAN WORK, FOR EXAMPLE,
20060613061815.706|20060613061817.074|CC1|WITH THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEAST
20060613061817.174|20060613061818.842|CC1|ASIA TO KEEP THEM STRONG SO THAT
20060613061818.909|20060613061820.577|CC1|TERRORISTS WILL NOT TAKE OVER IN
20060613061820.644|20060613061821.545|CC1|THOSE COUNTRIES.
20060613061821.611|20060613061823.346|CC1|THE PROSPECTS LOOK GOOD, BUT THE
20060613061823.413|20060613061826.450|CC1|PROSPECTS ARE STILL -- IT'S
20060613061826.516|20060613061827.784|CC1|STILL VERY VOLATILE IN THE
20060613061827.851|20060613061829.519|CC1|MIDDLE EAST AND OUR BEST HOPE OF
20060613061829.586|20060613061831.321|CC1|PEACE IN THE WORLD IS TO MAKE
20060613061831.388|20060613061833.623|CC1|SURE THAT WE GET A STABLE IRAQ
20060613061833.690|20060613061835.492|CC1|AND A STABLE AFGHANISTAN AND
20060613061835.559|20060613061836.359|CC1|BUILD FROM THERE.
20060613061836.426|20060613061836.927|CC1|>> OK.

20060613064913.562|20060613064914.062|CC1|TRUE.
20060613064914.129|20060613064914.663|CC1|THAT'S SAD.
20060613064914.729|20060613064916.498|CC1|>> GUYS LIKE PETER BOYLE'S

20060613064918.266|20060613064921.002|CC1|>> NO, NO, DAVID GARTH WAS

20060613064921.703|20060613064922.837|CC1|>> BUT YOU HAD GUYS THAT WERE

20060613064925.740|20060613064930.745|CC1|LEE ATWATER AND ROGER AILES WAS
20060613064930.812|20060613064931.680|CC1|REALLY GOOD.
20060613064931.746|20060613064934.649|CC1|>> THEY'RE ALL CUT FROM THE SAME
20060613064934.716|20060613064935.350|CC1|CLOTH.
20060613064935.417|20060613064935.750|CC1|STRATEGISTS.
20060613064935.817|20060613064937.252|CC1|>> THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE GUYS

20060613064938.653|20060613064939.087|CC1|>> THAT'S TRUE.
20060613064939.154|20060613064940.288|CC1|THEY'RE VERY, VERY SMART ON THE
20060613064940.355|20060613064942.390|CC1|WRONG SIDE, BUT THEY'RE SMART.
20060613064942.457|20060613064943.858|CC1|>> SO HOW COME THE DEMOCRATS
20060613064943.925|20060613064950.999|CC1|DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE
20060613064951.099|20060613064951.833|CC1|SVENGALIS?
20060613064951.900|20060613064952.334|CC1|>> I DON'T KNOW.
20060613064952.400|20060613064953.268|CC1|>> THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE
20060613064953.335|20060613064954.369|CC1|BACK ROOM BOYS --
20060613064954.436|20060613064955.971|CC1|>> MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE
20060613064956.037|20060613065000.375|CC1|NATURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC -- THE
20060613065000.442|20060613065001.643|CC1|IDENTITY THE DEMOCRAT IS TO BE
20060613065001.710|20060613065002.978|CC1|OPEN TO ALL POINTS OF VIEW AND
20060613065003.044|20060613065005.513|CC1|THAT'S WHY IT'S HARD TO
20060613065005.580|20060613065006.081|CC1|COALESCE.
20060613065006.147|20060613065007.549|CC1|I THINK NOW IS THE TIME THEY'D
20060613065007.616|20060613065008.783|CC1|BETTER, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A
20060613065008.850|20060613065009.851|CC1|GREAT CHANCE TO COME TOGETHER
20060613065009.918|20060613065010.619|CC1|AND THEY SHOULD.
20060613065010.685|20060613065013.655|CC1|AND THE OTHER SIDE IS ALL ABOUT
20060613065013.722|20060613065015.256|CC1|STRATEGY AND WINNING, AND SO
20060613065015.323|20060613065016.858|CC1|THERE'S THAT THINKING BEHIND IT,
20060613065016.925|20060613065018.059|CC1|WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU'VE GOT TO
20060613065018.159|20060613065019.494|CC1|WIN, AND WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT TO
20060613065019.561|20060613065021.563|CC1|COME UP WITH A STRATEGY TO WIN,
20060613065021.630|20060613065023.164|CC1|AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO
20060613065023.264|20060613065024.666|CC1|ELECTIONS, SO I THINK THAT'S THE
20060613065024.733|20060613065026.201|CC1|TENSION THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS
20060613065026.267|20060613065027.702|CC1|TO GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU CAN
20060613065027.769|20060613065029.137|CC1|ASK ANYBODY ON THE STREET AND
20060613065029.204|20060613065030.505|CC1|SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT A DEMOCRAT
20060613065030.572|20060613065031.406|CC1|STANDS FOR AND THEY'LL BE ABLE
20060613065031.473|20060613065032.641|CC1|TO GIVE THE SAME ANSWER AND
20060613065032.707|20060613065034.442|CC1|RIGHT NOW I'M NOT SURE THEY
20060613065034.509|20060613065035.043|CC1|COULD.
20060613065035.110|20060613065036.344|CC1|>> WILL ROGERS IS STILL CALLING

20060613065041.116|20060613065042.283|CC1|BUT WITH YOU LOOK AT HOW CLEVER

20060613065053.194|20060613065053.795|CC1|THAT.
20060613065053.862|20060613065055.764|CC1|>> THAT'S THE OLD STRAW DOG

20060613065101.536|20060613065103.838|CC1|I MEAN, I STILL THINK IT'S
20060613065103.905|20060613065105.407|CC1|PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREAT
20060613065105.473|20060613065111.579|CC1|SHAMEFUL ACTS TO GO AFTER OF A A

20060613065116.151|20060613065118.153|CC1|ACCUSE HIM OF BEING UNPATRIOTIC.
20060613065118.219|20060613065119.521|CC1|I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE OF THE
20060613065119.587|20060613065121.156|CC1|MOST CRIMINALLY OFFENSIVE MOVES
20060613065121.222|20060613065122.624|CC1|I COULD IMAGINE, BUT THEY'LL DO
20060613065122.691|20060613065124.025|CC1|IT BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT WINNING
20060613065124.092|20060613065125.093|CC1|AND THAT'S WHAT THE CANDIDATE
20060613065125.160|20060613065125.560|CC1|WAS ABOUT.
20060613065125.627|20060613065127.662|CC1|>> THE CANDIDATE WAS ALSO ABOUT

20060613065136.271|20060613065137.706|CC1|WHEN DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THEY
20060613065137.772|20060613065140.308|CC1|COULD WIN.
20060613065140.375|20060613065141.910|CC1|I REMEMBER SEEING THE MOVIE WITH

20060613065149.451|20060613065150.819|CC1|IT WAS ALL FUN AND GAMES.

20060613073900.913|20060613073902.281|CC1|BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LOT OF YEARS
