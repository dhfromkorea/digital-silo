20060613045913.668|20060613045914.602|CC1|THE PRESS.

20060613045922.110|20060613045923.278|CC1|AND I BELIEVE IT WAS A MISTAKE
20060613045923.345|20060613045924.612|CC1|TO GET IN IRAQ, AND WE OUGHT TO
20060613045924.679|20060613045926.781|CC1|HAVE A WAY TO GET FOLKS HOME.
20060613045926.848|20060613045928.516|CC1|WHAT HE SAID IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
